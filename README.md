# 🚜 Bulldozer Price Prediction (Kaggle)

This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict the **sale price of used bulldozers** using historical sales data from the *Bluebook for Bulldozers* Kaggle competition.  
The workflow covers **data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and insights extraction**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Predict bulldozer auction prices based on historical attributes such as:
- **Sale date**
- **Machine age**
- **Usage type**
- **Product class**
- And other relevant features

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages/Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🧮 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Bluebook for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers)  
- **Description:** Historical sales records of bulldozers including product specifications, usage, and sale prices.
